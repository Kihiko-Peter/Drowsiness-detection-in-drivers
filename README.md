# Drowsiness-detection-in-drivers
## Context

Drivers who do not take regular breaks when driving long distances run a high risk of becoming drowsy a state which they often fail to recognize early enough. There are several causes of road accidents: driver negligence, weather conditions, road invisibility, drowsiness, alcohol consumption, etc. Alcohol consumption is the main reason for the majority of road accidents (Elizabeth King, 2016). In comparison, driver drowsiness is the second signiÔ¨Åcant cause (Mathilde Carlier, 2022; Statista).

In this project, we are going to build a driver drowsiness detection system that will detect if the eyes of the driver are close for too long and infer if the driver is sleepy or inactive.

## Experimental Design

1. Problem Statement

2. Data Sourcing 

3. Assesing the Data

4. Image Preprocessing which includes :

  (a) Reshaping the images

  (b) Reading all the images and converting them into an array of labels and features.

  (c) Shuffling the images to be picked at random to avoid overfitting.

  (d) Normalizing the pixels of the images.

5. Build a model using Convolutional Neural Networks.(CNN)

6. Challenge the Solution.

7. Conclusion and Recommendations
